# GoogleAfricaScholarship

Hello there, thank you for checking my repo here.

My name is Abae and I am a beneficiary of the Google Africa Scholarship 2018.
The GAS2018 offers an opportunity to the recepient to be able to pursue a course as selected during the application stage.

This course can be either in Android Development or Web Development.

I was selected in the Android Developer Track and I will be updating this as soon as I get enough time to do so.

Thank you.
